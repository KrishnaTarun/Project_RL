## Problem Statement

There are different types of experience replay, e.g.  prioritised experiencereplay  and  hindsight  experience  replay.   Compare  two  or  more  types  ofexperience replay.  Does the ‘winner’ depend on the type of environment?

## Experience Replays
We mainly experimented with three experience replays techniques which are:
```
- Naive Experience Replay 
- Prioritized Experience Replay
- Combined Experience Replay
```
